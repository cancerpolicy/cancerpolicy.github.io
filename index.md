# About the model
The model is described in detail in [Birnbaum et al 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26756332) (Annals of Internal Medicine). In brief, it is a state-transition microsimulation model that projects breast cancer mortality outcomes for a cohort of women. Users can specify early detection and treatment interventions and compare the resulting outcomes to those under a given standard of care.

# Run the model
To accommodate users of various backgrounds, we provide three levels of access. Click on the headings below to choose a level:

## 1. Basic web interface
**COMING SOON** Answer a series of questions to roughly customize our model for your location and intervention. No programming required. For users who do not have statistics on breast cancer stage and survival.

## 2. [Intermediate web interface](http://cancerpolicy.shinyapps.io/breastcancer/)
Customize the model for your location and intervention. No programming required. For users who can obtain breast cancer stage and survival statistics from the literature or registries.

## 3. [R package](https://github.com/cancerpolicy/bcimodel)
For finer control, use our R package _bcimodel_ to run your own analyses in the R programming language. For users with programming experience.
