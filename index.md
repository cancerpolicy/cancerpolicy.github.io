# Welcome to the early detection and treatment breast cancer model
We provide three levels of access to the model to accommodate users of various backgrounds. Click on the headings below to choose a level:

## 1. Basic web interface
**COMING SOON** Answer a series of questions to roughly customize our model for your location and intervention. No programming required. For users who do not have statistics on breast cancer stage and survival.

## 2. [Intermediate web interface](http://cancerpolicy.shinyapps.io/breastcancer/)
Customize the model for your location and intervention. No programming required. For users who can obtain breast cancer stage and survival statistics from the literature or registries.

## 3. [R package](https://github.com/cancerpolicy/bcimodel)
For finer control, use our R package _bcimodel_ to run your own analyses in the R programming language.
